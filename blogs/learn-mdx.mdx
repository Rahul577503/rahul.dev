# STYLIZE TEXT

**TABLES**

### Tables are a common extension of the official markdown definition (CommonMark). They can be formatted in quite a lot of ways:

```md
| _italic_       | **bold**    | strike­through | code in-line |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Column Title   |             |                 |              |
| Another Column | Bolded text |                 |              |
| One More       |             |                 | code         |
```
Renders as:

> Column Title bolded text
> Another Column
> One More

**HEADERS AND BREAKS**

**LISTS**

Lists can be unordered or ordered, which is determined by the symbol used to list them. Unordered lists have either -, +, or \*, while ordered lists require any integer followed by a . or ) character.

An ordered list:
```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

**LINKS**

There are two ways to create links. The most commonly used format includes brackets followed by parentheses: [ ] ( ) . To render a link to an image, begin with a !.

Unordered List Examples:

```md
- [Link inline this way](https://rahulmaurya.com)
- [Or add a title for the link](https://rahulmaurya.com "Google's Homepage")
- [Here is a relative link within a repository](../blob/master/LICENSE)
- ![I link to an image](path/to/image.png)
```

Combining the two:

The second format involves brackets, [ ][ ] or [ ], followed by a reference formatted with a bracket and colon, [ ]:, anywhere else in the document.
```md
1. First ordered list item
2. Second ordered list item (which shows as 2.)
```
Examples:

```md
- [Reference-style link][Case-insensitive Reference Text]
- [Numbers are commonly used][1]
- [Text can link on its own as a reference]
```
Indentation is needed for indented lists:

```md
- Indented lists require four spaces in most specifications
  - Sublists are implementation specific
  - Try it out and render to be sure it works
- Continuing the list after an indentation
```
URLs, in and out of angle brackets, will automatically get turned into links with most implementations. Both https://rahulmaurya.com and will render as links, as well as https://rahulmaurya.com on some renderings.

**BEST OF GITHUB FLAVORED MARKDOWN**

Task lists are a fantastic usage of the GitHub-specific implementation:
```md
- [x] Step one is complete
- [ ] Step two in this unordered list is
- [x] Step three is done as well
```

Renders as:

- ☐ Step one is complete
- ☑ Step two in this unordered list is
- ☐ Step three is done as well

Drop-downs are an incredible feature to tidy up files:

<CodeBlock code={`
<details>
  <summary>
    <p>Q1: What is the best website in the world?</p>
  </summary>
  A1: <a href="https://rahulmaurya.com">https://rahulmaurya.com</a>
</details>
`} language="html" />

### Renders as

<CodeBlock code={`
<details>
  <summary>
    <p>Q1: What is the best website in the world?</p>
  </summary>
  A1: https://rahulmaurya.com
</details>
`} language="html" filename="Sample.md" />

Nearly all programming languages are supported using this syntax (python, ruby, go, rust, javascript, and java to name a few).

You can also have language-specific syntax highlighting. Instead of having a code block of black-and-white text, append the language to the first set of backticks to have highlighting enabled:

<CodeBlock code={`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Your Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Contact Form</h2>
  <form action="/submit" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    <br><br>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
`} language="html" filename="index.html"/>
